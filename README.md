# Challenge time!

I have a challenge for you!

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your own name and a link your profile to names.txt and create an html file named after you in your forked version of this repository.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Create a pull request.
5. I will approve your pull request and merge it to the master branch.
That's it! You should see your name in this repo's version of names.txt. Bonus points if you alphabetically sort all the names.
If you want to become a maintainer, put your name and a link to your profile in maintainers.txt. I will then make you a maintainer.
